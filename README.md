# Agentic-Financial-Advisor-Multi-Modal-AI-Agent-for-Stock-Analysis
This project implements a Multi-Modal Agentic AI system for financial analysis, leveraging LLMs (DistilBERT, Groq), Phidata Framework, YFinance API, and DuckDuckGo Search. It autonomously retrieves stock data, market news, and financial insights, combining agent-based reasoning with real-time information retrieval.
